<h2>AeroCalc 0.11</h2>
<p>AeroCalc is a pure <a href="http://www.python.org/">python</a> package that performs various aeronautical engineering calculations.  Currently, it contains the following main modules:</p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">airspeed</td>
		<td>Airspeed conversions and calculations.  Contains functions that provide conversions between CAS, EAS, TAS and Mach number.  Also provides functions that convert between pitot and static pressures and CAS, EAS, TAS and Mach.  And, provides functions that convert between Mach number and TAS and ram temperature rise.  And finally, it provides an interactive mode when run directly, e.g. 'python airspeed.py'.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">default_units</td>
		<td>Defines the default units that are used by the other modules.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">ssec</td>
		<td>Currently contains functions to calculate true airspeed given GPS ground speed and track data from multiple runs on various tracks.  Will eventually also contain various calculations related to static source error correction.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">std_atm</td>
		<td>Contains a description of the 1976 International Standard Atmosphere up to 84.852 km (278,386 ft) altitude.  Provides functions that convert between pressure altitude and pressure, density, temperature, pressure ratio, density ratio and temperature ratio.  Calculates density altitude, including correction for humidity.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top">unit_conversion</td>
		<td>Converts between commonly used units for length, area, volume, pressure, density, temperature, force, power, speed, weight and aviation gasoline quantity.</td>
	</tr>
